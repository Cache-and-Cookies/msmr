            The Multi-System Model of Resilience (MSMR) conceptualizes
            resilience as a multidimensional capacity to respond to challenges
            across different domains. The MSMR was first introduced as a
            theoretical, multi-dimensional model in response to the limitations
            in existing literature regarding the ambiguities in defining
            resilience and the lack of multi-dimensionality in understanding
            resilience (Liu, Reed, & Girard, 2017).
          </p>
          <p>
            Following the publication, our team of researchers have developed an
            accompanying self-reported inventory (MSMR-Inventory) to measure the
            theoretical model. The resulting MSMR-I is a 27-items, self-reported
            scale scored on a 4-point Likert-type measure.

            We have conducted studies to validate and examine the factor
            structure and psychometric properties of MSMR-I in several
            populations. Psychometric properties of the MSMR-I and its
            associated subscales showed good reliability, and construct validity
            and criterion validity support its three-systems factor structure
            and relationship to functional outcomes of depression, anxiety, and
            stress.

          <p>
            The MSMR-I consists of three subscales: internal resilience, coping
            pursuits, and external resilience. Each subscale contains 9
            self-reported items, and can be used and interpreted independently
            of the other subscales. The MSMR-I is unique in that it can be used
            as an assessment tool to best capture where barriers to oneâ€™s
            resilience may lie. For details on how to use and interpret the
            MSMR-I, please contact us for access to user manual.
